A greenhouse gas (GHG) is any gaseous compound that is capable of absorbing and emitting infrared radiation, thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space, 
'trapping' it in the lower atmosphere and contributing towards the ongoing climate change. The major greenhouse gases in Earth's atmosphere are water vapor, 
carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and ozone (O3).

Global CO2 emissions have risen dramatically since the start of the industrial revolution. In 2021, CO2 emitted from energy combustion and industrial processes 
reached 36.3 gigatonnes (Gt), its highest ever annual level. Fossil fuel use is the primary source of CO2, but it is also emitted from direct human-induced impacts 
on forestry and other land use, such as through deforestation, land clearing for agriculture, and degradation of soils.

This project aims to investigate the correlation between know factors (as those are found in literature) and CO2 emissions worldwide, using the R programming language.
